/*

A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] (0 = P < Q < R < N).

For example, array A such that:
A[0] = -3
A[1] = 1
A[2] = 2
A[3] = -2
A[4] = 5
A[5] = 6

contains the following example triplets:

(0, 1, 2), product is -3 * 1 * 2 = -6
(1, 2, 4), product is 1 * 2 * 5 = 10
(2, 4, 5), product is 2 * 5 * 6 = 60

Your goal is to find the maximal product of any triplet.

Write a function:

int solution(vector<int> &A);

that, given a non-empty array A, returns the value of the maximal product of any triplet.

For example, given array A such that:
A[0] = -3
A[1] = 1
A[2] = 2
A[3] = -2
A[4] = 5
A[5] = 6

the function should return 60, as the product of triplet (2, 4, 5) is maximal.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [3..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [-1,000..1,000].
